# Spatial Ecosystem in R
<h3>Part 1 </h3>

*Kiranmayi Vadlamudi *

If your starting out as a beginner in R or maybe just learning to handle spatial data in R, navigating the spatial ecosystem in R can be seem bit overwhelming with its many packages. Choosing the right tool for your analysis can save a lot of time and make ones life much easier. In this article I will cover the bare minimum needed to get away with some simple yet beautiful mapping and some spatial data wrangling. If you are here for a quick walk through, scroll to the example else if you don't mind reading - have a go!:zap:

The history of R spatial ecosystem dates back to early 2000s with some of earliest versions of the packages being first written in S [1]. While some packages for spatial statistical analysis written then are still available on CRAN, there are several more newer packages on offer now. Academics from different fields such as ecology, transport, computer science, urban planning, quantitative geography etc have always dealt with spatial data but over the last few years, academics from these fields came together to develop the R spatial ecosystem and formalise it.

The increased computational power, access to cloud computing resources and the vast space-time varying data being generated on a daily basis has made spatial data analysis and geocomputation popular & a need to know to extract meaningful insights from your spatial data.


1. [sf package (short for Simple Features)](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) : First version came out in
  * what it does?

2. [sp package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/sp.pdf)

3. [tmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html): Personally, I am a big fan of this package and <3  it. It's saved so much time

4. [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)
